      <p class="lead">
        This web site came about when I realized French isn't taught with the latest scientific principles,
        and therefore is often hit or miss.

  <strong>frflashy.com</strong> is designed for <em>beginner</em> and <em>intermediate</em> French learners.
  If you’re already an advanced learner, you’ll probably find it too simple — and that’s okay!
  This space is meant to make the early stages of French fun, visual, and approachable.

  This site is <strong>vibe-coded</strong> — meaning I built it mostly by intuition and curiosity rather than formal training.
  I’ll be honest: I don’t fully understand much of the underlying tech — JavaScript, Flask, CSS, bootstrap, or even HTML.
  Many sections, including the vocabulary pages, were created entirely with the help of AI.
