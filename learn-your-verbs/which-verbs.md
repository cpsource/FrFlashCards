## 🇫🇷 **Regular Verbs (the backbone of French)**

These follow predictable patterns, so they’re great for mastering endings.

| Verb           | Meaning        | Notes                           |

## 💡 **Study Roadmap**

1. Start with 3 regular verbs in each group (total 9).
   → Master endings & pronunciation.
2. Add the 10–12 irregular verbs (focus on **être, avoir, aller, faire, venir, pouvoir, vouloir, devoir** first).
3. Practice them in **présent**, **passé composé**, **imparfait**, and **futur proche**.
4. Add **short contextual phrases**, e.g.

   * *Je vais au marché.*
   * *Il a fait beau hier.*
   * *Nous devons partir bientôt.*
