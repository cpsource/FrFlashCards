Here are **5 platforms** that let you accept payments or donations without directly handling credit-card infrastructure. I’ve listed their **key features, typical fees**, and how they might fit your site (frflashy.com).

| Platform                        | Best for                                                              | Fees / Notes                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Buy Me a Coffee**             | Simple one-time donations or light recurring memberships              | 5% platform fee on all payments. No monthly fee. ([Buy Me a Coffee][1])                                                   |
| **Patreon**                     | Membership tiers, recurring payments, wider audience support          | Platform fee 5-12% (or ~10% for new creators) + payment processing. ([Patreon Help Center][2])                            |
| **Gumroad**                     | Selling digital products, memberships, simple checkout pages          | Free to start; ~10% per transaction + credit-card processing fees. ([Gumroad][3])                                         |
| **Stripe (Checkout / Billing)** | Full control, you own the logic, but easier checkout hosted by Stripe | You still handle logic; Stripe hosts payment page. No large platform fee, standard card processing applies. ([Stripe][4]) |
| **Liberapay**                   | Donations, especially for free/open content; minimal overhead         | Nonprofit; no platform fee on donations. ([Wikipedia][5])                                                                 |

### 🔍 My Recommendations for frflashy.com

* For Tier 1 (free) + optional donations: **Buy Me a Coffee** or **Liberapay** make it very simple.
* For Tier 2-N paid membership levels: **Patreon** or **Gumroad memberships** could work well.
* If you want full control and integrate into your own site/backend: **Stripe Checkout/Billing** is the most flexible (but requires some setup).

If you like, I can **compare what each platform supports for “subscription tiers”** specifically (e.g., recurring payments vs one-time, integration options, international support) and pick the **best fit** for your membership tier model.
