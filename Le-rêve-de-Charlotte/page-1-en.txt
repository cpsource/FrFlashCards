Charlotte's Dream.

Go Charlotte, go!
Charlotte runs, the ball rolls ahead of her on the grass.
– Go! Run!
The fans sitting in the stadium stands shout to encourage their team. The match is spectacular. The tension is high between the two Marseille teams. Nassima, the midfielder, is in a good position to get the ball. She calls out to Charlotte:
– The ball, Charlotte! Pass!
But Charlotte continues her run. She keeps running and kicks the ball.
GOAL!
– Yes!!! Well done!!! the players shout.
Everyone is cheering. The final whistle blows. It's a victory for the FAM team, the Associated Female Footballers of Marseille.

the grass - the lawn.
to shout - to yell very loudly.
the whistle - the referee's signal.
